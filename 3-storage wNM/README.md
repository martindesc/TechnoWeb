# Lab 3 : Storage

Hello, unfortunatly, i couldn't finish this lab. During the course, I had a problem where my npm start didn't work and even after asking for your help, we couldn't find why it didn't work. Here is what my termninal shows :
```bash
npm ERR! code ELIFECYCLE
npm ERR! errno 1
npm ERR! 3-storage@1.0.0 start: `ts-node src/server.ts`
npm ERR! Exit status 1
```
Eventho the script in package.json is correct, my computeur refuses to launch the app.

## Asking a comrade

Because I took too long trying to debug (in vain) my code, I asked at the end of the course to Marko Arsovic if he could help me with my problem. He gave me what he did so far, but in the end, I still have the same problem with the command npm start.
